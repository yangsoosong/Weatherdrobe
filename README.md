# Weatherdrobe

We help you decide what you wear for the days depending on the items you added on your wardrobe!

A clothing/weather application that helps users decide what they should wear based on the weather forecast, and keeps track of what clothing the user has worn in order to recommend a day to do laundry so the user is never unprepared for the weather!

We are using weather API for our app.
https://darksky.net/dev -> "As long as you make fewer than 1,000 calls each day, the API is free."

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
